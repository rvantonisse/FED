# Front-end Development

Assignments for the [course Front-end development](https://github.com/CMDA/FED1) followed at the "Hogeschool van Amsterdam" (current course may differ from previous courses).
The final assignment was to create a responsive website.

## Course contents

1. HTML5
	* HTML5 specfic tags
	* HTML5 forms
	* Semantic mark-up
2. CSS3
	* Selectors
	* border-radius
	* box-shadow // text-shadow
	* transforms
	* transitions
	* @media-queries
3. JavaScript
	* Progressive enhancement with Modernizr.js (but I havent used it because I found that this website was degrading gracefully enough, except for the use of css :target selector maybe. This was not supported with Modernizr. Only loaded as assesment requirement.)
	* Introduction to conditioner.js

## Assignment specific
